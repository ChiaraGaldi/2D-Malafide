2D-Malafide is a novel and lightweight adversarial attack designed to deceive face deepfake detection systems. Building upon the concept of 1D convolutional perturbations explored in the speech domain, our method leverages 2D convolutional filters to craft perturbations which significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art face deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional additive noise approaches, 2D-Malafide optimises a small number of filter coefficients to generate robust adversarial perturbations which are transferable across different face images.

Experiments are conducted using the FaceForensics++ dataset: https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics

Additionally, we report an explainability analysis using GradCAM: https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam
which illustrates how 2D-Malafide misleads detection systems by altering the image areas used most for classification.

## 2d-Malafide application for CADDM and SBI
To determine the effectiveness of the adversarial filter attack we used the following two
FDD systems:
- CADDM [[3]](#caddm) is a deepfake detection system developed to address the problem of Im-
plicit Identity Leakage.
- Self-Blended Images (SBIs) [[4]](#sbi) is a deepfake detection system which leverages
training data augmentation to improve generalisability. The key idea behind SBIs is that
the use of more general and barely recognisable fake samples encourage classifiers to learn
generic and robust representations without overfitting to manipulation-specific artefacts.
Fake samples are generated by blending pairs of pseudo source and target images, obtained
using different image augmentation transformations, thereby increasing the difficulty of
the face forgery detection task and encouraging the learning of more generalisable models.
The implementations of both CADDM and SBIs used in this work support the use of differ-
ent backbone architectures. For our experiments, both methods use EfficientNet convolu-
tional neural networks, the only difference being that we use efficientnet-B3 for CADDM,
but efficientnet-B4 for SBIs. Models pre-trained using the FF++ training dataset are used
for both methods and are available on the respective GitHub repositories
